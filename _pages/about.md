## About Me
I am an experienced Machine Learning Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in autonomous driving and space industry.\\
After finishing my undergraduate study in 2017, I started my professional career as a Scientist in Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). As part of the Payload Data Management Group, I was involved in the development of payload data processing system for Indian Lunar Mission (chandrayaan-2). I was also involved in the development of deep learning solutions for hyperspectral images. ISRO had relied on traditional computer vision techniques for hyperspectral image classification and segmentation. Using UNET architecture for image segmentation, we were able to demonstrate the superior performance of deep learning algorithms on hyperspectral imaging datasets.\\
For the last 3 years, I have been working at Hertzwell, a Singapore-based startup which is developing high resolution radar imaging solutions for autonomous vehicles. During my time at Hertzwell, I have worked on the design & implementation of state of the art algorithms for pointcloud processing. 

My key area of interests are the following:
- Lidar/Radar Pointcloud processing: Object Detection & Panoptic Segmentation 
- Image Classification, detection, segmentation & tracking 
- Synchronization of multi-modal systems like Lidar, Radar & Camera.


In my free time, I enjoy competing on Kaggle competitions. Recently I ranked 3rd in Kaggle Rainforest Audio Detection Challenge.
